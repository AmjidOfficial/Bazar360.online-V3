* **App Protection:** Firebase App Check with Google reCAPTCHA v3 verification pipelines.
* **Media Management:** Cloudinary Media API for rapid, lossless, unsigned image and video uploads with real-time watermark placement.

## 📦 Local Installation & Setup

Follow these steps to configure your local development environment:

### 1. Clone & Re-link Remote Path
If you are re-linking or setting up the local repository path:
```bash
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/AmjidOfficial/BAZAR360.git
```

### 2. Install Package Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Setup Environment Secrets
Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:
```env
# reCAPTCHA v3 Verification Secret
VITE_RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY=your_recaptcha_v3_site_key

# Google Gemini AI Integration Key
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key

# Firebase SDK Client Config Keys
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_api_key
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project.firebaseapp.com
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project.appspot.com
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_CHECK_DEBUG_TOKEN=optional_debug_token

# Cloudinary Integration Configuration
VITE_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_cloud_name
VITE_CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET=your_unsigned_upload_preset
```

### 4. Run Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```
*The application will boot a local development Express server running at `http://localhost:3000` with the hot Vite dev environment mounted.*

### 5. Production Compiles
To compile the frontend client assets and bundle the Express server into a standalone self-contained CommonJS file:
```bash
npm run build
```

## 🛡️ Git & Security Hygiene (`.gitignore`)
The project utilizes a pre-configured, highly restrictive `.gitignore` file. It ensures that local environment secrets (`.env`, `.env.local`), `node_modules`, standard compiled directories (`dist/`, `build/`), temporary IDE metadata files (`.idea/`, `.vscode/`), and testing outputs are **never** leaked to the remote version control.

---

## 🌐 Dynamic SEO & Metadata Engine
The custom-designed SEO component (`src/components/SEO.tsx`) handles advanced meta-tag generation:
1. **Dynamic OpenGraph/Twitter Cards:** Generates optimized preview imagery using on-the-fly Cloudinary transformation paths (resizing assets to exact 1200x630 specifications for OpenGraph previews).
2. **JSON-LD Schema Indexing:** Injects valid structural specifications (Organization, AutoDealer, FAQ, BreadcrumbList, and Vehicle) directly into the document header. This includes price currencies, showroom coordinates, item conditions, and availability statuses for search indexing.

## 🌍 Global Production Deployment
Bazar360 is optimized for static deployment to GitHub Pages or container deployment to Cloud Run.

To deploy static branches to GitHub Pages:
```bash
npm run deploy
```
